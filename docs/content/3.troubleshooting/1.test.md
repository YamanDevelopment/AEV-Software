# Troubleshooting

## Computer no worky??? :(

1. Check if the power cord is plugged in. It is a USB-C cable, so make sure it is plugged in all the way.

2. Check if the screen is on, because its hardware switch is based on how close a certain light is to a surface.

3. Hopefully the SD card is not corrupted. If it is, there will be a couple other SD cards in the vehicle we can use to swap out. Simply turn the Pi off and swap the SD cards.

## Data being wonky!!!

1. Check if the GPS is plugged in. It is a USB device, so make sure it is plugged in all the way. You may also want to hit the `Restart GPS` button.

2. Check if the GPS is getting a signal. If it is not, you may need to move the car to a different location. The GPS is based on how many satellites it can see, so if it is not getting a signal, it may be because of the location. It is located in the top left corner of the vehicle by the front left passenger seat's window.

3. Check if the VPN is connected. If it is not, you may need to restart the VPN. This can be done by going to the last workspace and pressing the `Restart VPN` button.

4. Check if the BMS is connected. If it is not, you may need to restart the BMS. This can be done by going to the last workspace and pressing the `Restart BMS` button.

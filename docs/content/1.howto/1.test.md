# How do I use the software?

## Getting Started

The software will automatically load up when the car is turned on. The software is designed to be as user-friendly as possible, with a simple interface that is easy to navigate. Please keep in mind that it may take up to 20 seconds for the software to fully load. To move across different "workspaces" in the software, there are buttons on the bar labeled `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, and `5`. These buttons will take you to different workspaces, where you can view different information about the car. The bar also has the time because thats always nice to have you know. There is also a system tray and a couple of other things but all that really pertains to the people in the vehicle is the buttons of workspaces and perhaps time.

Once you have loaded into the software, you will be greeted with the main dashboard. This dashboard will display all of the live data that the car is currently collecting. This includes the speed of the car, the battery percentage, and the current lap time. You can also view the live telemetry data from the car, which will show you the current state of the battery, motor, and other key components. This data is updated in real-time, so you can always stay up to date with the car's performance.

## Workspace Layout / Window Layout

### -- Workspace 1 Landing Page --

On the first workspace, you will see a render of a car on a track, which does actually move when the car moves, though not accurate to the speed of the vehicle, and a lot of information related to the GPS speed, a small view of the rear camera, a bunch of BMS data, a lap timer, and controls for the car. 

### -- Workspace 2 Cameras --

On the second workspace, you will see a grid with the rear camera on top, and left and right blindspot cameras. They may be a little wide, but to "unwiden" them simply tap on the camera you want to see, and it will be displayed in full screen. Tap it again to unwiden it. 

### -- Workspace 3 --

On the third workspace, there is the custom horn soundboard on the left, have fun with that if you want, and on the right is the questionably official AEV music playlist with a music player.

### -- Workspace 4 --

On the fourth workspace, there are some settings, just gnome-control-center. There are some basic things you can do here but frankly is probably not important related to the race.

### -- Workspace 5 Debug Window --

On the ~~5th day of Christmas~~ fifth and final workspace, you may see a lot of jibberish on the left, but this is the debug terminal, where you can see the logs of the software. This workspace isn't really meant for YOU to understand, but to us the developers, can help a lot. There is something **important** here though, which is the right half of the screen. Here you have a couple of buttons, which state of sending the data to a Google Sheet which is used for comprehensive raw logging. There are also buttons to `Restart BMS`, `Restart GPS`, and to`Restart VPN`. The VPN is used to get data across the track in real time, the BMS is well the battery management system, and the GPS is the GPS. There is also raw BMS debug and raw BMS alerts.

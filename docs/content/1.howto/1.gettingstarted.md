# Getting Started

## How do I use the software?


The software will automatically load up when the car is turned on. The software is designed to be as user-friendly as possible, with a simple interface that is easy to navigate. Please keep in mind that it may take up to 20 seconds for the software to fully load. To move across different pages in the software, there are buttons on the bar labeled with little icons. These buttons will take you to different pages, where you can view different information about the car.

Once you have loaded into the software, you will be greeted with the camera page (navigate back to the main dashboard with the bottom left home button). This dashboard will display all of the live data that the car is currently collecting. This includes the speed of the car, the battery percentage, and the current lap time (you control the lap times). You can also view the live telemetry data from the pits, which will show speed and BMS data. This data is updated in real-time, so you can always stay up to date with the car's performance (slight lag and cutoffs in the pits are possible due to our hotspot + VPN system).

  Lap measuring technology

  Automatic telemetry logging
  #description
  While all interfaced components are running, alongside visually displaying all of the live data, our backend automatically logs every inch of data to a JSON file which then exports to a google sheet automatically.

  Rear and Blindspot cameras
  #description
  Implementing [USB Arducams](https://www.arducam.com/product/arducam-1080p-day-night-vision-usb-camera-2mp-infrared-webcam-with-automatic-ir-cut-switching-and-ir-leds/), we mounted 3 cameras (1 rear and 2 left/right blindspots) to have almost a full 180 view of everything around us.

  Adaptive 3D CyberSedan Model
  #description
  Based on the original 3D CADs of our car, we use an STL and 3D rendered model of the car alongside a 3D scene to create a live view of the car on the screen just like Teslas have which moves when we drive as well.

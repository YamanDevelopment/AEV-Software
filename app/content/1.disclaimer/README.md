To anyone who may be reading this in the future, these docs are actually more of a time capsule as it holds the last second instructions and explainations the AEV coding subteam made for our teammates before the race. You won't find fancy specialized and thought out docs for some open source project or anything...

That being said, there is a demo now that[ I ](https://zachl.tech)made for people to go see what the custom software looks like on the actual dashboard with dummy data, alongside a gallery from our trip to Texas for the solar car challenge including photos of the dashboard itself ðŸ˜„
